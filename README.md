# Daily-Playlist-YT
Updates a predefined playlist with all the videos from your "My Subscription" page. It accomplishes this task by using a combination of
the YouTube Data v3 API and multiple JSON requests. Super primitive but the objective was to use only javascipt/jquery/html/css. 
Since YouTube caps playlist sizes to a maximum of 200 videos I will need to find a way to remove the oldest songs from the list to make room for new submissions.
